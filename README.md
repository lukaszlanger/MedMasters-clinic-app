# MedMasters Clinic App üè•ü©∫

An application that supports a medical clinic with various specializations. The project was created as part of programming laboratories in a group of four. My contribution to the project is the entire frontend and connection of the database with Views.
The application is used to support the entire medical clinic. There is a login system for employees. Employees can edit patient cards, appointments, add doctors or new medicines to the medicine warehouse. The application is based on the support of the medical clinic's database.
